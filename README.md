# Hello-World
My Initiation Process

Hello fellow jellos! My name is Miguel and I am currently a civil engineering major with a huge interest in Structural Engineering and Seismic Design. I have worked on a shake table previously before with a few friends back in my community college. As of this moment, I am currently working with our student chapter of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute at Cal Poly Pomona. 

Hope you all are well and enjoy or find something useful of what I've worked with so far.
